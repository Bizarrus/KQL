# Important rules for using the Knuddels chat

## If you use other people's photos
- Only upload a profile picture if you can ensure that it will not be found online by **reverse image search engines**. Check the images under the following search engines for hits:
  - [TinEye.com](https://tineye.com)
  - [Google images](https://google.com/imghp)
  - [Google Lens](https://lens.google.com/search?p=)
  - [Yandex](https://yandex.com)
- Do **not use AI**-generated images that also look like AI images. You can usually tell straight away whether an image has been generated.
- Upload pictures to a photo album without adding a first-person reference to the album. So don't name the album “I am” or “Its me”
- Make sure that the photos comply with the rules and do not violate the rules. Remember the following **S.A.M. principle**:
  - **Sexual**
     - **No** Breast nipples
     - **No** nudes
     - Private parts such as the vagina or penis must not push through clothing (for sample CamelToes)
  - **Age**
     - The picture must be appropriate to the age selected
     - **No** children may be seen in the pictures
  - **Messenger**
     - **No** messenger or messenger name may be displayed on the images (no Instagram name, no messenger QR codes or similar)
  
## When you write content in the chat
Please note that the following content can lead to your account being blocked immediately:
- Searching for “sugar daddies”
- The outing that you sell pictures/videos (including sexual ones)
- Anything to do with money
- External messengers are now prohibited. So refrain from referring to messengers (Snapchat, Telegram, Kik, TeleGuard, Skype and others,...) in your profile or as a message.
