# KQL
`KQL` is an Client-Wrapper for the unofficial [Knuddels.de](https://knuddels.de/) Chat-Community API.

# How does KQL work?
`KQL` uses a `WebSocket` client and a `graphql` interface that can connect to and communicate with the Knuddels chat server.

# What can I use KQL for?
You can use `KQL` to read or write data from the community. Among other things, it is possible to develop bots with the interface.

# Why is Node.js used?
We have worked with several prototypes using different programming languages. Server-side JavaScript using Node.js proved to be the most useful here, as other programming languages have various restrictions.
