enum EditContactFilterSettingsResponseError {

	INTERNAL,

	# The request failed validation. At the time of writing, there are no inputs that permit invalid data entry
by the user, therefore we can simplify our error handling to a single bug-indicating bad request error instead
of a more complex validation error system.
